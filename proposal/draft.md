Description: This project will be a maps app that specializes in scooter/moped/limited speed motorcycle navigations. These vehicles are challenging to operate on higher speeds/main roads. This project will be aimed to find side roads and tailor navigation directions for scooter/moped/limited speed motorcycle riders based on speed limit.




Interactive portion: Custom map view that the user can click to set start and end points for navigations. Directions will also be displayed on this custom map view. There is also a search bar to let users put in directions, and several fields for the user to identify if they are a scooter/moped or limited speed motorcycle rider, highway avoidance, and maximum speed.




API: https://apidocs.geoapify.com/docs/routing/ - this is the routing api that i will be using to get directions based on user preference and display it on the map view.
